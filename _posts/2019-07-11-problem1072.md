## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given a matrix consisting of 0s and 1s, we may choose any number of columns in the matrix and flip every cell in that column.  Flipping a cell changes the value of that cell from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.     
Return the maximum number of rows that have all values equal after some number of flips.
