## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.      
Return a deep copy of the list.      

Example 1:      
![Explain Image1](img/img138.png )      

Input:   
{"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}     

Explanation:   
Node 1's value is 1, both of its next and random pointer points to Node 2.   
Node 2's value is 2, its next pointer points to null and its random pointer points to itself.    
 
Note:     
You must return the copy of the given head as a reference to the cloned list.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
1. First thought is that we create a HashMap to put all nodes and node's value; then in second loop, link pointers according to relationship of the old nodes(next, random, node). Then return first node in map.    
2.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
Two loop and one HashMap.   

    /*
    // Definition for a Node.
    class Node {
       public int val;
       public Node next;
       public Node random;

       public Node() {}

       public Node(int _val,Node _next,Node _random) {
          val = _val;
          next = _next;
          random = _random;
       }
     };
    */
    
    class Solution {
     public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
        //prepare for result
        Node result = null;
        
        //check for extreme condition
        if(head == null){
            return result;
        }
        
        Node node = head;
        
        //Create a HashMap to record every node and its value
        HashMap<Node, Node> map = new HashMap<> ();  //first node for current node, second node for later use 
        while(node != null){
            // map.put(node, new Node(node.val, null, null));// it is ok.
            map.put(node, new Node(node.val));
            node = node.next;
        }
        
        //link pointers, according to relationship of the old nodes
        node = head;
        while(node != null){
            map.get(node).next = map.get(node.next);
            map.get(node).random = map.get(node.random);
            node = node.next;
        }
        
        return map.get(head);
        
     }
    }
