## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average O(1) time.       

<b> Note: Duplicate elements are allowed. </b>        
insert(val): Inserts an item val to the collection.   
remove(val): Removes an item val from the collection if present.    
getRandom: Returns a random element from current collection of elements. The probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of same value the collection contains.       

Example:   

// Init an empty collection.    
RandomizedCollection collection = new RandomizedCollection();    

// Inserts 1 to the collection. Returns true as the collection did not contain 1.    
collection.insert(1);    

// Inserts another 1 to the collection. Returns false as the collection contained 1. Collection now contains [1,1].    
collection.insert(1);    

// Inserts 2 to the collection, returns true. Collection now contains [1,1,2].    
collection.insert(2);    

// getRandom should return 1 with the probability 2/3, and returns 2 with the probability 1/3.    
collection.getRandom();    

// Removes 1 from the collection, returns true. Collection now contains [1,2].    
collection.remove(1);    

// getRandom should return 1 and 2 both equally likely.    
collection.getRandom();
