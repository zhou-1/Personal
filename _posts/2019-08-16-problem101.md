## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).     

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:    

    1    
   / \   
  2   2   
 / \ / \   
3  4 4  3     
   

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:     

    1    
   / \    
  2   2    
   \   \    
   3    3    
 

Note:    
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

Two trees are a mirror reflection of each other if:    
I. Their two roots have the same value.     
II. The right subtree of each tree is a mirror reflection of the left subtree of the other tree.
