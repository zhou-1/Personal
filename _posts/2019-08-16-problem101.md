## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).     

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:    

    1    
   / \   
  2   2   
 / \ / \   
3  4 4  3     
   

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:     

    1    
   / \    
  2   2    
   \   \    
   3    3    
 

Note:    
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.     


----------------------------------

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

Two trees are a mirror reflection of each other if:    
I. Their two roots have the same value.     
II. The right subtree of each tree is a mirror reflection of the left subtree of the other tree.     

1) Recursion

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
Recursion    

    class Solution {
      //recursion
      public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        return isMirror(root, root);
      }
    
      public boolean isMirror(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2){
        if(t1 == null && t2 == null){
            return true;
        }
        if(t1 == null || t2 == null){
            return false;
        }
        return isMirror(t1.val == t2.val)
            && isMirror(t1.left, t2.right)
            && isMirror(t1.right, t2.left);
      }
    }
