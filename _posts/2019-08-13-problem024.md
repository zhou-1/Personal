## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.      
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.      

Example:    
Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
