## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.     
Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.      
Example 1:   
Input: [1,2,3,1]   
Output: true   
Example 2:   
Input: [1,2,3,4]   
Output: false    
Example 3:   
Input: [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]    
Output: true
