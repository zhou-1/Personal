## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.    
Example:   
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9, Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, return [0, 1].   



----------------------------------

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.    
We can only iterate for one number for saving time. First, set up a new HashMap; second, iterate in nums array; get the value of difference between target and each value of array, if the complement exists in 

----------------------------------

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
Code in Java.     

    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
      Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
      
      for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i); //store in each value and its place
      }
      
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("No two sum solution");
    }
