## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.     
Examples:   
s = "leetcode"   
return 0.    
s = "loveleetcode",   
return 2.   
Note: You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.
