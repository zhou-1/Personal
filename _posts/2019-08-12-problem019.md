## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.      

Example:     
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.      
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.      

Note:    
Given n will always be valid.

Could you do this in one pass?
