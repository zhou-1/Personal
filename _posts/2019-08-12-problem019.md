## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.      

Example:     
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.      
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.      

Note:    
Given n will always be valid.       

Follow up:     
Could you do this in one pass?

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

We notice that the problem could be simply reduced to another one : Remove the (L - n + 1)(L−n+1) th node from the beginning in the list , where LL is the list length. This problem is easy to solve once we found list length LL.      

I. Two pass algorithm      
First we will add an auxiliary "dummy" node, which points to the list head. The "dummy" node is used to simplify some corner cases such as a list with only one node, or removing the head of the list. On the first pass, we find the list length LL. Then we set a pointer to the dummy node and start to move it through the list till it comes to the (L - n)(L−n) th node. We relink next pointer of the (L - n)(L−n) th node to the (L - n + 2)(L−n+2) th node and we are done.       

II. One pass/ Two pointer algorithm     
The above algorithm could be optimized to one pass. Instead of one pointer, we could use two pointers. The first pointer advances the list by n+1 steps from the beginning, while the second pointer starts from the beginning of the list. Now, both pointers are exactly separated by nn nodes apart. We maintain this constant gap by advancing both pointers together until the first pointer arrives past the last node. The second pointer will be pointing at the nnth node counting from the last. We relink the next pointer of the node referenced by the second pointer to point to the node's next next node.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
Two pass solution    

    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        //add an auxiliary "dummy" node, which points to the list head. 
        //The "dummy" node is used to simplify some corner cases such as a list with only one node, 
        //or removing the head of the list.
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        
        int length = 0;
        
        ListNode first = head;
        
        //iterate the list and get the length
        while(first != null){
            length++;
            first = first.next;
        }
        
        //start to move it through the list till it comes to the (L - n)(L−n) th node.
        length -= n;
        first = dummy;
        while(length > 0){
            length--;
            first = first.next;
        }
        //end the loop, it is (L-n)th node, relink to (L - n + 2)th node
        first.next = first.next.next;
        
        return dummy.next;
        
    }

One pass / Two pointer algorithm     

    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        
        ListNode first = dummy;
        ListNode second = dummy;
        
        // Advances first pointer so that the gap between first and second is n nodes apart
        for(int i = 1; i <= n + 1; i++){
            first = first.next;
        }
        
        // Move first to the end, maintaining the gap
        while(first != null){
            first = first.next;
            second = second.next;
        }
        
        second.next = second.next.next;
        return dummy.next;
        
    }
