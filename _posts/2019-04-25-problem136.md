## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.    
Note:   
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?    
Example 1:   
Input: [2,2,1]   
Output: 1    

Example 2:    
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]   
Output: 4    


----------------------------------

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
My initial idea is creating a HashTable to store all elements, since all elements except one appear twice, first time we meet the elemnt, we add in hash table; second time we meet the same element, we then delete/pop it; at the end, it will only keep the only one that appear once.   
After check answer, ORZ, find this intellgient answer with XOR bit manipulation. A XOR B, if A and B are same, then result is 0; if A and B is different, the result is not 0. Therefore, currently, I think it only works in (a, a, 1) or (a, a, b, b, 1) cases not in (a,b, a, b, 1) case. Need update.    
Update: A XOR B XOR A XOR B = (A XOR A) XOR (B XOR B) = 0 XOR 0 = 0.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
Code in Java.     

    class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int result = 0;
        for(int i : nums) {
            result ^= i;
        }
        return result;
     }
    }
