## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.    
Note:   
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?    
Example 1:   
Input: [2,2,1]   
Output: 1    

Example 2:    
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]   
Output: 4
