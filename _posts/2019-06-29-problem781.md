## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
In a forest, each rabbit has some color. Some subset of rabbits (possibly all of them) tell you how many other rabbits have the same color as them. Those answers are placed in an array.      
Return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.     

Examples:    
Input: answers = [1, 1, 2]   
Output: 5  
Explanation:    
The two rabbits that answered "1" could both be the same color, say red.   
The rabbit than answered "2" can't be red or the answers would be inconsistent.   
Say the rabbit that answered "2" was blue.   
Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer into the array.    
The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that didn't.       

Input: answers = [10, 10, 10]     
Output: 11      

Input: answers = []    
Output: 0     

Note:      
answers will have length at most 1000.     
Each answers[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 999].

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.           

First thought is using HashMap to store each element and its frequence. And while iterating the element in map, we need to consider a lot of corner cases. But it too fussy. For corner cases, we can simplify it.    

Second solution, still use same HashMap. But for corner cases, we need to think deeper.        
If x+1 rabbits have same color, then we get x+1 rabbits who all answer x.    
now n rabbits answer x.   
If n % (x + 1) == 0, we need n / (x + 1) groups of x + 1 rabbits.   
If n % (x + 1) != 0, we need n / (x + 1) + 1 groups of x + 1 rabbits.    
the number of groups is math.ceil(n / (x + 1)) and it equals to (n + x) / (x + 1) , which is more elegant.

Third solution, use sorting. For every element, check for int t-- equals 0 OR current element equals previous element, if so, r = current element, total updated too.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
HashMap<element, frequence>    

    public int numRabbits(int[] answers) {
        //prepare for result
        int res = 0;
        
        //check for extreme condition
        if(answers == null || answers.length == 0){
            return res;
        }
        
        //HashMap<element, frequence>
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<> ();
        for(int i : answers){
            //meet 0, add 1 directly
            if(i == 0){
                res++;
            }
            else{
                map.put(i, map.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        //iterate for map
        for(int i : map.keySet()){
            //frequence: odd number and element cannot cover freqeunce-1 (1 is itself)
            if(map.get(i) % 2 == 1 && map.get(i) != 1 && i < (map.get(i) - 1) ){
                res = res + (i + 1) * ((map.get(i) / (i + 1)) + 1);
            }
            //frequence: odd number and element can cover frequence-1
            else if(map.get(i) % 2 == 1 && map.get(i) != 1 && i >= (map.get(i) - 1) ){
                res = res + i + 1;
            }
            //frequence is 1 
            else if(map.get(i) == 1){
                res += i + 1;
            }
            //frequence: even number and frequence of element is bigger than 1
            else{
                if(i != 1){
                    //element can cover frequence-1
                    if(i >= map.get(i) - 1 ){  //[4,4]; [3,3,3,3]
                        res += i + 1;
                    }
                    //element cannot cover freqeunce-1
                    else{ //[4,4,4,4,4,4];[2,2,2,2] 
                        res += (i + 1) * (map.get(i) / (i + 1) + 1);
                    } 
                }
                else{ //i == 1
                    res += (i + 1) * (map.get(i) / (i + 1));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return res;
        
    }

Think deep for covering all corner cases    

    public int numRabbits(int[] answers) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> m = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i : answers)
            m.put(i, m.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
        int res = 0;
        for (int i : m.keySet())
            res += (m.get(i) + i) / (i + 1) * (i + 1);
        return res;
    }

Sorting     

       public int numRabbits(int[] a) {
	  Arrays.sort(a);
	  int total = 0, r = 0;
	  for(int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
		if (r-- == 0 || a[i] != a[i-1]) {
			r = a[i];
			total += a[i]+1;
		}
	  }
	  return total;
       }



### Code in Python.   
HashMap and think deep about corner cases.    

       def numRabbits(self, answers):
           c = collections.Counter(answers)
           return sum((c[i] + i) / (i + 1) * (i + 1) for i in c)
