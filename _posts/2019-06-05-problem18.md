## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in nums such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.      

Note:     
The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.    

Example:    
Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.     

A solution set is:   
[  
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],   
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],   
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]   
]

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
My thought is using ideas from Two sum and Three sum. First, sort array and use Two sum to have one value and three sum, then use Three sum for rest of three numbers. Actually, all ksum problem can be divided into two problems: 1. 2sum Problem; 2. Reduce K sum problem to K â€“ 1 sum Problem.
