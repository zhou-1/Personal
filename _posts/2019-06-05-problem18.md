## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in nums such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.      

Note:     
The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.    

Example:    
Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.     

A solution set is:   
[  
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],   
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],   
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]   
]
