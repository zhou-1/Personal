## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).     
Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and coordinates of points are all in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).     

Example:   
Input:   
[[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]    
Output:   
2    
Explanation:    
The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]     
My Explanation:    
In 1st answer, [1,0] is i, [0,0] is j, [2,0] is k, therefore, [1,0] to [0,0] is 1, [1,0] to [2,0] is 1, too.      
In 2nd answer, [1,0] is i, [2,0] os j, [0,0] is k.     
Difficult part here is there can be at most 500 points in the list, so we have to compare all of them.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
One difficult part here is two-dimensional array.
