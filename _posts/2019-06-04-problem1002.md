## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including duplicates).  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.     
You may return the answer in any order.     

Example 1:    
Input: ["bella","label","roller"]   
Output: ["e","l","l"]   
Example 2:   
Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]   
Output: ["c","o"]    

Note:    
1 <= A.length <= 100   
1 <= A[i].length <= 100   
A[i][j] is a lowercase letter
