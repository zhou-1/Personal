## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.     
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:     
a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.       

Example 1:     
Given the following tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]:      
    3   
   / \   
  9  20    
    /  \    
   15   7      
   
Return true.        

Example 2:     
Given the following tree [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]:     

       1    
      / \   
     2   2   
    / \   
   3   3   
  / \   
 4   4    
 
Return false.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

Recursion.     
Java solution based on height, check left and right node in every recursion to avoid further useless search     

I was also confused by the return -1.    
Please understand that when you return something in recursion it goes to the calling function just above the stack.     
Take the example [1,2,2,3,null,null,3,4,null,null,4], this is a case where the tree is unbalanced at 2 but balanced at root that is 1.
Now lets us consider the case where we do NOT write if (lH==-1 || rH==-1) return -1; then only the call that was one step above the stack receives -1 but the thing is once we find the difference is -1, there is no point in further calculations (cause the tree will be unbalanced).     
And to propagate this we have to return -1 everytime without changing the value until the first call on the stack which is in the isBalanced() function.
