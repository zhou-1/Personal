### II) 1109. Corporate Flight Bookings (medium)       
There are n flights, and they are labeled from 1 to n.     
We have a list of flight bookings.  The i-th booking bookings[i] = [i, j, k] means that we booked k seats from flights labeled i to j inclusive.     
Return an array answer of length n, representing the number of seats booked on each flight in order of their label.     

Example 1:    
Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5    
Output: [10,55,45,25,25]    

Constraints:    
1 <= bookings.length <= 20000    
1 <= bookings[i][0] <= bookings[i][1] <= n <= 20000   
1 <= bookings[i][2] <= 10000
