First try in contest.     

I) Distribute Candies to People     
We distribute some number of candies, to a row of n = num_people people in the following way:      
We then give 1 candy to the first person, 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give n candies to the last person.      
Then, we go back to the start of the row, giving n + 1 candies to the first person, n + 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give 2 * n candies to the last person.      
This process repeats (with us giving one more candy each time, and moving to the start of the row after we reach the end) until we run out of candies.  The last person will receive all of our remaining candies (not necessarily one more than the previous gift).         

Java    

    public int[] distributeCandies(int candies, int num_people) {
        int[] people = new int[num_people];
        for (int give = 0; candies > 0; candies -= give) {
            people[give % num_people] +=  Math.min(candies, ++give);
        }
        return people;
    }

Python    

    def distributeCandies(self, candies, n):
        res = [0] * n
        i = 0
        while candies > 0:
            res[i % n] += min(candies, i + 1)
            candies -= i + 1
            i += 1
        return res


II) Path In Zigzag Labelled Binary Tree      
In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are labelled in row order.      
In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is left to right, while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...), the labelling is right to left.       
![Explain Image1](img/contest0-II-0.png ) 

Given the label of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from the root of the tree to the node with that label.       

Example 1:      
Input: label = 14    
Output: [1,3,4,14]     

Example 2:     
Input: label = 26    
Output: [1,2,6,10,26]     

Constraints:     
1 <= label <= 10^6
