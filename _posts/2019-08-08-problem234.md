## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.      

Example 1:     
Input: 1->2    
Output: false   

Example 2:     
Input: 1->2->2->1    
Output: true    

Follow up:    
Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

This can be solved by reversing the 2nd half and compare the two halves. Let's start with an example [1, 1, 2, 1].    
In the beginning, set two pointers fast and slow starting at the head.      

1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> null       
sf     

(1) Move: fast pointer goes to the end, and slow goes to the middle.     

1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> null      
          s at 2      f at null       
          
(2) Reverse: the right half is reversed, and slow pointer becomes the 2nd head.       

1 -> 1    null <- 2 <- 1             
h at 1                 s at 1         

(3) Compare: run the two pointers head and slow together and compare.     

1 -> 1    null <- 2 <- 1                
     h at 1       s at 2
