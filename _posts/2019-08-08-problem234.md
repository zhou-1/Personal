## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.      

Example 1:     
Input: 1->2    
Output: false   

Example 2:     
Input: 1->2->2->1    
Output: true    

Follow up:    
Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?    


----------------------------------

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

This can be solved by reversing the 2nd half and compare the two halves. Let's start with an example [1, 1, 2, 1].    
In the beginning, set two pointers fast and slow starting at the head.      

1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> null       
sf     

(1) Move: fast pointer goes to the end, and slow goes to the middle.     

1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> null      
          s at 2      f at null       
          
(2) Reverse: the right half is reversed, and slow pointer becomes the 2nd head.       

1 -> 1    null <- 2 <- 1             
h at 1                 s at 1         

(3) Compare: run the two pointers head and slow together and compare.     

1 -> 1    null <- 2 <- 1                
     h at 1       s at 2

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
Two pointers    

    class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null){ //[]
            return true;
        }
        if(head != null && head.next == null){
            return true; //i.e. [1]   
        }
        
        ListNode fast = head, slow = head;
        
        //move fast and slow nodes
        while(fast != null && fast.next != null){
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        
        //odd nodes: let right half smaller
        //fast != null but fast.next == null
        if(fast != null){
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        
        slow = reverse(slow);
        fast = head;
        
        while(slow != null){
            if(fast.val != slow.val){
                return false;
            }
            
            fast = fast.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
    public ListNode reverse(ListNode head){
        ListNode prev = null;
        while(head != null){
            ListNode temp = head.next;
            head.next = prev;
            prev = head;
            head = temp;
        }
        
        return prev;
    }
    
    }


### Code in Python.   
Reverse first half and compare with second half    

    def isPalindrome(self, head):
      rev = None
      slow = fast = head
      while fast and fast.next:
        fast = fast.next.next
        rev, rev.next, slow = slow, rev, slow.next
      if fast:
        slow = slow.next
      while rev and rev.val == slow.val:
        slow = slow.next
        rev = rev.next
      
      return not rev
