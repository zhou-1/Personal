## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.    
Example 1:   
Input: "abcabcbb"   
Output: 3    
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.    
Example 2:    

Input: "bbbbb"    
Output: 1   
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.   

Example 3:   
Input: "pwwkew"    
Output: 3    
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and see others' solving methods.    
In loop, if there is no duplicate character, keep int i same, if not, update i to maximum of (current i or current place of duplicate character); also in the loop, we update ans of maximum of current i and (j-i+1) and put every character in HashMap.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.   
Code in Java.    

    public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length(), ans = 0;
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(); // current index of character
        // try to extend the range [i, j]
        for (int j = 0, i = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (map.containsKey(s.charAt(j))) {
                i = Math.max(map.get(s.charAt(j)), i);
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, j - i + 1);
            map.put(s.charAt(j), j + 1);
        }
        return ans;
     }
    }
