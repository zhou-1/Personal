## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.      
Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.     

Example 1:    
Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2    
Output: ["i", "love"]     
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words. Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.      

Example 2:     
Input: ["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is", "is"], k = 4    
Output: ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]    
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.      

Note:     
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.    
Input words contain only lowercase letters.     

Follow up:    
Try to solve it in O(n log k) time and O(n) extra space.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
Initial thought is that using HashMap<String, Integer> to record word and its frequence; then from big to small for frequence to sort the ans list from map; at the end,re turn sublist(0, k) for ans list.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
HashMap<String, Integer> and sort for ans list    

    public List<String> topKFrequent(String[] words, int k) {
        //Prepare for result
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<> ();
        
        //check for extreme condition
        if(words == null || words.length == 0){
            return res;
        }
        
        //HashMap<String, frequence>
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<> ();
        for(String word : words){
            map.put(word, map.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList(map.keySet());
        
        Collections.sort(ans, (a, b) -> map.get(a).equals(map.get(b)) ? a.compareTo(b) : map.get(b) - map.get(a) );
        //map.get(a) - map.get(b): 从小往大
        //map.get(b) - map.get(a), reverse: 从大往小
        
        return ans.subList(0, k);
        
    }
