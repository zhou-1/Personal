## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Reverse a singly linked list.       

Example:     
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL    
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL      

Follow up:    
A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.
