## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.    

Example 1:    
Input: [0,1]    
Output: 2    
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.     

Example 2:    
Input: [0,1,0]    
Output: 2     
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.      

Note: The length of the given binary array will not exceed 50,000.
