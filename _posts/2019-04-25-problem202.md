## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".   
A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.    
Example:    
Input: 19   
Output: true   
Explanation:    
1^2 + 9^2 = 82   
8^2 + 2^2 = 68   
6^2 + 8^2 = 100   
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
First, I try to find when the loop will never ends and I find the property that if it never ends, it will become 4 at some time, then we can use this property to check.   
Second, we can use hashset to store all final elements in a loop. Once we find same element, we can jump out of the loop and check whether there is 1 inside the loop. if there exists, this is a happy number; otherwise, it is not.
