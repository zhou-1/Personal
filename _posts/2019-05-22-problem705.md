## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    




----------------------------------

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
My initial thoughts is creating an int array to store all possible values. In add method, we let value of key be key and check for 0 since initial values are 0; then at remove method, let value of key all be -2.    
I uploaded my solution here on LC website: https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashset/discuss/297031/My-Java-easy-understandable-int-array-solution-(not-boolean-array)!   
After that, I checked the solution from others, they are using boolean array. Kind of similar to my solution. Using boolen array

boolean array: https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashset/discuss/273257/Java-solution-(99.7)

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
My code with int[]     

       class MyHashSet {

       //private Boolean isExist = false;
       private int[] HS = new int[1000001]; //problem this is if we have 0 in test

       /** Initialize your data structure here. */
       public MyHashSet() {
    
       }

       public void add(int key) {
              HS[key] = key;
    
              //for 0
              if (key == 0){
                     HS[key] = -1;
              }
    
       }
       
       public void remove(int key) {
              HS[key] = -2;
    
       }

       /** Returns true if this set contains the specified element */
       public boolean contains(int key) {
              if(key == 0){
                     if(HS[key] == -1){
                            return true;
                     }
              }
              else{
                     if(HS[key] == key){
                            return true;
                     }
              }

       return false;
       }
      }
