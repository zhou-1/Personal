## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.      
Example 1:    
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3   
Output: true   
Example 2:   
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1   
Output: true   
Example 3:   
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2   
Output: false
