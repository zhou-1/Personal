## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
In an array A of 0s and 1s, how many non-empty subarrays have sum S?      

Example 1:     
Input: A = [1,0,1,0,1], S = 2    
Output: 4   
Explanation:     
The 4 subarrays are bolded below:    
[1,0,1]      
[1,0,1,0]      
[0,1,0,1]       
[1,0,1]     

Note:     
A.length <= 30000    
0 <= S <= A.length    
A[i] is either 0 or 1.
