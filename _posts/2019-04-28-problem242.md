## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.       
Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram (相同字母异序词) of s.      
Example 1:       
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"   
Output: true   
Example 2:   
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"   
Output: false    
Note:   
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.    
Follow up:    
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?
