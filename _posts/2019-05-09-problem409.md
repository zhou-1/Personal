## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.     
This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.    

Note:    
Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.     
Example:   
Input:   
"abccccdd"    
Output:   
7   
Explanation:   
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        



wrong!!!

Your input
"abccccdd"
Output
6
Expected
7

       class Solution {
       public int longestPalindrome(String s) {
        int[] freq = new int[256];
        int res = 0;
        
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        
        for(char c : chars){
            freq[c]++;
            
            if((freq[c] / 2) == 1 && freq[c] > 0){
                freq[c] = 0;
                res += 1;
            }
            
            
        }
        
        //length of palindrome should be twice
        res *= 2;
        
        return res;
    }
    }
