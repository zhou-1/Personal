## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.     
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.     

Example:    
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],     
One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:     

      0    
     / \   
   -3   9   
   /   /   
 -10  5
