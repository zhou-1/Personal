## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.     
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.     

Example:    
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],     
One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:     

      0    
     / \   
   -3   9   
   /   /   
 -10  5

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

height balanced BST: Height is balanced is enough! So pick middle node as root, low as left, high as right.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
Recursion    

    class Solution {
      public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] num) {
        if (num.length == 0) {
            return null;
        }
        
        TreeNode head = helper(num, 0, num.length - 1);
        return head;
      }

      public TreeNode helper(int[] num, int low, int high) {
        if (low > high) { // Done
            return null;
        }
        
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        TreeNode node = new TreeNode(num[mid]);
        node.left = helper(num, low, mid - 1);
        node.right = helper(num, mid + 1, high);
        
        return node;
      }
    }
