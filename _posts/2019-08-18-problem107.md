## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).   

For example:     
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],    
    3    
   / \    
  9  20    
    /  \    
   15   7     
return its bottom-up level order traversal as:    
[    
  [15,7],    
  [9,20],    
  [3]   
]

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

My initial idea is using stack with its FILO property, then I first we can use list.add(0, ) to avoid
