## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.        

Example 1:    
Input:   
"tree"     
Output:   
"eert"    
Explanation:    
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.    
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.     

Example 2:    
Input:   
"cccaaa"   
Output:   
"cccaaa"   
Explanation:    
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.    
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.    

Example 3:   
Input:   
"Aabb"    
Output:   
"bbAa"      
Explanation:    
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.    
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
Cannot use char[] since size is used for number od elements also the size is for elements in [].      
We should use list instead of char[].
