## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.     

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.    

Example 1:     
Input:     1         1   
          / \       / \   
         2   3     2   3   

        [1,2,3],   [1,2,3]   

Output: true    

Example 2:      
Input:     1         1   
          /           \   
         2             2    

        [1,2],     [1,null,2]    

Output: false     

Example 3:     
Input:     1         1   
          / \       / \   
         2   1     1   2    

        [1,2,1],   [1,1,2]     

Output: false
