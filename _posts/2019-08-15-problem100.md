## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.     

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.    

Example 1:     
Input:    
           1         1   
          / \       / \   
         2   3     2   3   

        [1,2,3],   [1,2,3]   

Output: true    

Example 2:      
Input:    
           1         1   
          /           \   
         2             2    

        [1,2],     [1,null,2]    

Output: false     

Example 3:     
Input:    
           1         1   
          / \       / \   
         2   1     1   2    

        [1,2,1],   [1,1,2]     

Output: false

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

I. Recursion    
Intuition    
The simplest strategy here is to use recursion. Check if p and q nodes are not None, and their values are equal. If all checks are OK, do the same for the child nodes recursively.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
Recursion    

    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        //recursion
        if(p == null && q == null){
            return true;
        }
        
        if(p == null || q == null){
            return false;
        }
        
        if(p.val != q.val){
            return false;
        }
        
        return isSameTree(p.right, q.right) && isSameTree(p.left, q.left);
        
    }



### Code in Python.
