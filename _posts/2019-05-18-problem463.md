## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.      
Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).     
The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.      

Example:     
Input:    
[[0,1,0,0],    
 [1,1,1,0],   
 [0,1,0,0],   
 [1,1,0,0]]    

Output: 16    
Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
When I first understand the question, my initial thought is that if there is 1, we should check surroundings arround it. If there is another 1 around it, it contributes 3; if there are two 1 around it, it contributes 2; if there are three 1 around it, it contributes 1; if there are four 1 around it, it contributes 0.    
However, my current code always miss 1. I also update [my question here](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/discuss/294596/Need-help-for-my-Java-solution!), any help is appreciated. .... Need update.         
After check the solution in discussion, I found that we can only check down and right neighbours for 1. In first row, we no need to worry about up, for other rows, top element has chcked down neighbour for current element's up neighbour. Same thing for right element. So, if we have island, multiply by 4; if there is island as down or right neighbour, update 1 on neighbour. Final result then will be island* 4 - neighbour* 2.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
My initial vesion for checking all surroundings around 1. Will always miss 1. Need update.      
       
    class Solution {
    public int islandPerimeter(int[][] grid) {
        //Initialize an int for result
        int result = 0; 
        int island = 0, water = 0;
        //record the length of each row
        int len = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++){
                len = grid[i].length;
                
                //if it is a land
                if(grid[i][j] == 1){
                    island += 1;
                    
                    //count up neighbour: first row, water, land
                    if(i == 0 ){
                       result += 1; 
                    }
                    else if(i < grid.length - 1 && grid[i-1][j] == 0){
                        result += 1;
                    }
                    //land, ignore it
                    
                    
                    //count down neighbour: last row, water, land
                    if(i == grid.length - 1){
                        result += 1;
                    }
                    else if(i < grid.length - 1 && grid[i+1][j] == 0){
                        result += 1;
                    }
                    //land, ignore it
                    
                    
                    //count left neighbour: first column, water, land
                    if(j == 0){
                        result += 1;
                    }
                    else if(j < grid[i].length - 1 && grid[i][j-1] == 0){
                        result += 1;
                    }
                    //land, ignore it
                    
                    
                    //count right neighbour: last column, water, land
                    if(j == grid[i].length - 1){
                        result += 1;
                    }
                    else if(j < grid[i].length -1 && grid[i][j+1] == 0){
                        result += 1;
                    }
                    //land, ignore it
                           
                }
                else{
                    water += 1;
                }
                
            }
                 
        }
        
        if((water + island) == grid.length * len){
            return result;
        }
        
        return -1;
        
     }
    }

Only need to check for number of islands and number of neighbours around the island.    

       public int islandPerimeter(int[][] grid){
         int islands = 0, neighbours = 0;
         
         for(int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++){
           for(int j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++){
             if(grid[i][j] == 1){
               islands++;
               //count down neighbours
               if(i < grid.length - 1 && grid[i+1][j] == 1){
                 neighbours++;
               }
               //count right neighbours
               if(i < grid[i].length - 1 && grid[i][j+1] == 1){
                 neighbours++;
               }
             }
           }
         }
       
         return islands*4 - neighbours*2;
       }
