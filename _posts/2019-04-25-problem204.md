## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.    
Example:   
Input: 10   
Output: 4   
Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.     


----------------------------------

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
Test the extreme case, once n<=2 (count the number of prime numbers less than n), return 0; create one boolean[] isNotPrime which the default values are false; in a outer loop, int i starts from 2; in a inner loop,  int j starts from 2, isNotPrime[i*j] = true.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
Code in Java.     

       class Solution {
              public int countPrimes(int n) {
                     if(n <= 2){
                            return 0;
                     }
        
                     //create a boolean array to store non-prime int     
                     //default is false
                     boolean[] isNotPrime = new boolean[n];
        
                     int count = 0;
                     for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
                            if (isNotPrime[i] == false) {
                                   count++;
                                   for (int j = 2; i*j < n; j++) {
                                          isNotPrime[i*j] = true;
                                   }
                            }
                     }

                     return count;
        
              }
    }
