## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.     
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.     
Find the letter that was added in t.     

Example:    
Input:    
s = "abcd"   
t = "abcde"   
Output:   
e  

Explanation:   
'e' is the letter that was added.   

official example is not good, shuffle means original characters of string s will be randomly put in string t:   
s= "abcd"   
t= "decab"    

Find the different character (will at random place of string t) between two string.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        


wrong!!But why?????

    class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char[] charS = s.toCharArray();
        char[] charT = t.toCharArray();
        
        if(s.length() == 0){
            return charT[0];
        }
        
        HashSet<Character> HS = new HashSet<Character>();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            HS.add(charS[i]);
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < t.length(); i++){
            if(HS.contains(charT[i])){
                HS.remove(charT[i]);
            }
            else{
                return charT[i];
            }
        }
        
        return charT[0];
        
    }
}
