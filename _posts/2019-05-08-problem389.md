## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.     
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.     
Find the letter that was added in t.     

Example:    
Input:    
s = "abcd"   
t = "abcde"   
Output:   
e  

Explanation:   
'e' is the letter that was added.   

official example is not good, shuffle means original characters of string s will be randomly put in string t:   
s= "abcd"   
t= "decab"    

Find the different character (will at random place of string t) between two string.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
Initially, I would like to use HashSet and HashMap to record every elements of shoter string s, and then compare with each element of longer string t. However, HashSet cannot contain duplicates in value, HashMap cannot contain duplicates in key. But there is also a way we store duplicates in value of HashMap and give different key for each of them.    
Secondly, I tried to create a char array list to store every elements of shorter string s, and compare with each element of longer string t. However, it shows IndexOutOfBoundsException error. If anyone know, please contact with me or leave message on my [help page on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/discuss/289155/Need-help-for-Java-solution-with-arraylist). Thanks!!

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
Code in Java.     

       public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        //char[] charS = s.toCharArray();
        //char[] charT = t.toCharArray();
        
        if(s.length() == 0){
            return t.charAt(0);
        }
        
        //since there are 26 letters
        int[] res = new int[26];
        
        // add 1 for each element in string s
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            res[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        
        //
        for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); i++){
            
            if(--res[t.charAt(i) - 'a'] < 0){
                return t.charAt(i);
            }
        }
        
        return 0;
        
       }
