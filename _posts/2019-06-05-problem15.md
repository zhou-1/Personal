## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.      

Note:     
The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.     

Example:     
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],       

A solution set is:     
[   
  [-1, 0, 1],   
  [-1, -1, 2]   
]
