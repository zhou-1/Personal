## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.    
Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.    

Example 1:   
Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"   
Output: true   
Example 2:   
Input:pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish"   
Output: false   
Example 3:   
Input: pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"   
Output: false   
Example 4:   
Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog"   
Output: false   
Notes:    
You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters that may be separated by a single space.
