## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.     
Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.     

Example 1:     
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"     
Output: true     
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.    
Example 2:    
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"    
Output: false    
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.    
Example 3:     
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"    
Output: false     
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).    

Note:    
1 <= words.length <= 100   
1 <= words[i].length <= 20   
order.length == 26    
All characters in words[i] and order are english lowercase letters

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
Biggest difficulty is dictionary sort. 12345 > 1289 > 131 > 501 > 580 > 987.         
https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%AD%97%E5%85%B8%E5%BA%8F/7786229?fr=aladdin     
Next difficulty is search, continue search, and continue.     
search: it is like a statement for the function???     
continue search: continue for the search loop.       
continue: only ends current loop at this time, and go to rest part of loop. 结束当前循环,并进入下一次循环,即仅仅这一次循环结束了,不是所有循环结束了          
I am using HashMap here to store all elements of string order. HashMap<Character, Integer> for chracter and its order (0,1,2,3....). Then check for every two words i and j for their characters in same order. 
In solution, people are using int[] but in same idea.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
HashMap with search method.     

    class Solution {
     public boolean isAlienSorted(String[] words, String order) {
        //prepare a boolean value for result
        boolean result = false;
        
        //check for extreme condition
        if(words.length == 1){
            return true;
        }
        
        //store the elements of order in HashMap
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<> ();
        for(int i = 0; i < order.length(); i++){
            map.put(order.charAt(i), i); //lmkjn, 01234
        }
        
        //compare word one by one
        search: for(int i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++){ //no need to worry about last word in words[]
            String word1 = words[i];
            String word2 = words[i + 1];
            
            //compare charatcer by character
            for(int j = 0; j < Math.min(word1.length(), word2.length()); j++){
                //if character is not same
                if(word1.charAt(j) != word2.charAt(j)){
                    //if bigger, it is false
                    if(map.get(word1.charAt(j)) > map.get(word2.charAt(j)) ){
                        return result;
                    }
                    //if smaller, check next words
                    else if(map.get(word1.charAt(j)) < map.get(word2.charAt(j)) ){
                        continue search; 
                        //check next words
                        //but what if there are only two words, abc and q, abcq:0123
                        
                        
                    }
                    //if same, next
                    else if(map.get(word1.charAt(j)) == map.get(word2.charAt(j)) ){
                        continue; //continue for next loop for j
                    }
                    
                }
                
            }
            
            //if all of the minimum length of words are same
            //words like "app", "apple"
            if(word1.length() > word2.length()){
                return result;
            }
            
        }
        
        return true;
     }
    }

int array.    

    class Solution {
     public boolean isAlienSorted(String[] words, String order) {
        int[] index = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < order.length(); ++i)
            index[order.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i;

        search: for (int i = 0; i < words.length - 1; ++i) {
            String word1 = words[i];
            String word2 = words[i+1];

            // Find the first difference word1[k] != word2[k].
            for (int k = 0; k < Math.min(word1.length(), word2.length()); ++k) {
                if (word1.charAt(k) != word2.charAt(k)) {
                    // If they compare badly, it's not sorted.
                    if (index[word1.charAt(k) - 'a'] > index[word2.charAt(k) - 'a'])
                        return false;
                    continue search;
                }
            }

            // If we didn't find a first difference, the
            // words are like ("app", "apple").
            if (word1.length() > word2.length())
                return false;
        }

        return true;
     }
    }



### Code in Python.   

       def isAlienSorted(self, words, order):
          m = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(order)}
          words = [[m[c] for c in w] for w in words]
          return all(w1 <= w2 for w1, w2 in zip(words, words[1:]))
