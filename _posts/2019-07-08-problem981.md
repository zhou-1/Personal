## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Create a timebased key-value store class TimeMap, that supports two operations.      

1. set(string key, string value, int timestamp)       
* Stores the key and value, along with the given timestamp.      

2. get(string key, int timestamp)    
* Returns a value such that set(key, value, timestamp_prev) was called previously, with timestamp_prev <= timestamp.     
* If there are multiple such values, it returns the one with the largest timestamp_prev.   
* If there are no values, it returns the empty string ("").    

Example 1:     
Input: inputs = ["TimeMap","set","get","get","set","get","get"], inputs = [[],["foo","bar",1],["foo",1],["foo",3],["foo","bar2",4],["foo",4],["foo",5]]     
Output: [null,null,"bar","bar",null,"bar2","bar2"]    
Explanation:     
TimeMap kv;      
kv.set("foo", "bar", 1); // store the key "foo" and value "bar" along with timestamp = 1       
kv.get("foo", 1);  // output "bar"        
kv.get("foo", 3); // output "bar" since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 ie "bar"       
kv.set("foo", "bar2", 4);      
kv.get("foo", 4); // output "bar2"      
kv.get("foo", 5); //output "bar2"       

Example 2:     
Input: inputs = ["TimeMap","set","set","get","get","get","get","get"], inputs = [[],["love","high",10],["love","low",20],["love",5],["love",10],["love",15],["love",20],["love",25]]      
Output: [null,null,null,"","high","high","low","low"]       
 
Note:     
All key/value strings are lowercase.     
All key/value strings have length in the range [1, 100]     
The timestamps for all TimeMap.set operations are strictly increasing.    
1 <= timestamp <= 10^7    
TimeMap.set and TimeMap.get functions will be called a total of 120000 times (combined) per test case.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

I. HashMap<String, TreeMap<Integer, String>> for (key, TreeMap<timestamp, value>). Since one key has multiple special timestamps, we need key and proper timestamp to get value. In TreeMap, there is a method call .floorKey(k) can return the maximum key which less than or equal to k.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
HashMap<key, TreeMap<timestamp, value>>      

    class TimeMap {
       private Map<String, TreeMap<Integer,String>> map;
    
       /** Initialize your data structure here. */
       public TimeMap() {
         map = new HashMap<> ();
       }
    
    

       public void set(String key, String value, int timestamp) {
          if(!map.containsKey(key)){
             map.put(key, new TreeMap<> () );
          }
        
          map.get(key).put(timestamp, value);
       }
    
    
       public String get(String key, int timestamp) {
        
          String res = "";
        
          TreeMap<Integer, String> treeMap = map.get(key);
          if(treeMap == null){
              return res;
          }
        
          Integer floor = treeMap.floorKey(timestamp); //方法调用返回的最大键小于等于key，或者null，如果不存在这样的键。
          if(floor == null){
               return res;
          }
        
          res = treeMap.get(floor);
          return res;
       }
    }

    /**
    * Your TimeMap object will be instantiated and called as such:
    * TimeMap obj = new TimeMap();
    * obj.set(key,value,timestamp);
    * String param_2 = obj.get(key,timestamp);
    */
