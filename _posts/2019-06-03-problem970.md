----------------------------------

## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given two positive integers x and y, an integer is powerful if it is equal to x^i + y^j for some integers i >= 0 and j >= 0.     
Return a list of all powerful integers that have value less than or equal to bound.     
You may return the answer in any order.  In your answer, each value should occur at most once.     

Example 1:     
Input: x = 2, y = 3, bound = 10    
Output: [2,3,4,5,7,9,10]    
Explanation:    
2 = 2^0 + 3^0   
3 = 2^1 + 3^0   
4 = 2^0 + 3^1   
5 = 2^1 + 3^1   
7 = 2^2 + 3^1   
9 = 2^3 + 3^0   
10 = 2^0 + 3^2    
Example 2:    
Input: x = 3, y = 5, bound = 15    
Output: [2,4,6,8,10,14]     

Note:
1 <= x <= 100   
1 <= y <= 100    
0 <= bound <= 10^6    


----------------------------------

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
Not a good question. Use brute force method.     
Check every i and j under 20, since 2^20+1=1048576+1=1048577>10^6=1000000, cover all possible solutions.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
Brute method.   

    class Solution {
     public List<Integer> powerfulIntegers(int x, int y, int bound) {
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet();
        for (int i = 0; i < 20 && Math.pow(x, i) <= bound; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < 20 && Math.pow(y, j) <= bound; ++j) {
                int v = (int) Math.pow(x, i) + (int) Math.pow(y, j);
                if (v <= bound)
                    seen.add(v);
            }

        return new ArrayList(seen);
        
     }
    }


### Code in Python.   

       def powerfulIntegers(self, x, y, bound):
          xs = {x**i for i in range(20) if x**i < bound}
          ys = {y**i for i in range(20) if y**i < bound}
          return list({i + j for i in xs for j in ys if i + j <= bound})
