----------------------------------

## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
We are given two sentences A and B.  (A sentence is a string of space separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)   
A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.      
Return a list of all uncommon words.      
You may return the list in any order.       

Example 1:    
Input: A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"     
Output: ["sweet","sour"]      
Example 2:    
Input: A = "apple apple", B = "banana"     
Output: ["banana"]      

Note:    
0 <= A.length <= 200    
0 <= B.length <= 200    
A and B both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.     
Uncommon word = word that appears only once in sentence 1 and sentence 2.    
My initial idea is creating a HashMap<String, Integer> to record each string in A[] and B[] and its frequence, if the final value for the string is 1, then it is the uncommon one we need.      


----------------------------------

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
One HashMap to check the frequence.    

    class Solution {
     public String[] uncommonFromSentences(String A, String B) {
        //prepare a String[] for result
        String[] result =null;
        
        //check for extreme condition
        if(A.length() == 0 && B.length() == 0){
            return result;
        }
        
        //convert string to string[]
        String[] arrayA = A.split("\\s");
        String[] arrayB = B.split("\\s");
        
        //create a HashMap for arrayA
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<> ();
        for(String a : arrayA){
            map.put(a, map.getOrDefault(a, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for(String b : arrayB){
            map.put(b, map.getOrDefault(b, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        //need an ArrayList for modifying elements
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<> ();
        
        for(String s : map.keySet()){
            if(map.get(s).equals(1)){
                list.add(s);
            }
        }
        
        //convert s to result
        String[] ans = new String[list.size()];
        list.toArray(ans);
        
        return ans;
     }
    }




### Code in Python.   
Same idea.    

       def uncommonFromSentences(self, A, B):
          c = collections.Counter((A + " " + B).split())
          return [w for w in c if c[w] == 1]
