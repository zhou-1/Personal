----------------------------------

## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
We are given two sentences A and B.  (A sentence is a string of space separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)   
A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.      
Return a list of all uncommon words.      
You may return the list in any order.       

Example 1:    
Input: A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"     
Output: ["sweet","sour"]      
Example 2:    
Input: A = "apple apple", B = "banana"     
Output: ["banana"]      

Note:    
0 <= A.length <= 200    
0 <= B.length <= 200    
A and B both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.
