## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.     

Example:     
Input: [1,null,2,3]       
---1   
----\   
-----2  
----/   
---3   
Output: [1,3,2]     

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?     



----------------------------------

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
Point: Binary Tree Inorder Traversal means left node, root, right node.
