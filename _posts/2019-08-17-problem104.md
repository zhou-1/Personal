## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.     
The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.     

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.      

Example:     
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],    

    3   
   / \   
  9  20   
    /  \   
   15   7  
return its depth = 3.
