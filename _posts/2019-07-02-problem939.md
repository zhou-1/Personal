## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given a set of points in the xy-plane, determine the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the x and y axes.         
If there isn't any rectangle, return 0.      

Example 1:    
Input: [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[2,2]]     
Output: 4    

Example 2:    
Input: [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[4,1],[4,3]]    
Output: 2     

Note:     
1 <= points.length <= 500    
0 <= points[i][0] <= 40000   
0 <= points[i][1] <= 40000   
All points are distinct.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
I. Sort by columns.     
Count each rectangle by right-most edge. Group the points by x coordinates, so that we have columns of points. Then, for every pair of points in a column (with coordinates (x,y1) and (x,y2)), check for the smallest rectangle with this pair of points as the rightmost edge. We can do this by keeping memory of what pairs of points we've seen before.
