# List    

## ArrayList    
It is created by array, it is kind of like array but can change the size.    

    ArrayList<Integer> arrayList = new ArrayList<Integer>();


## LinkedList    
It is created by two-directed linked list.       
Compare with ArrayList, it is quicker at add and delte, slower at query and modify the value.     

    LinkedList<Integer> linkedList = new LinkedList<Integer>();

<b> linkedList.add() </b> add one new node to end of the linked list.    
<b> linkedList.addFirst() </b> add one new node to start of the linked list.     
<b> linkedList.clear() </b> loop through items, free all of the elemnts, set all of previous an dnext pointer to null.     
<b> linkedList.get(int index) </b> get the node at the pointed place        
<b> linkedList.contains() </b> return the length of linked list/number of nodes
