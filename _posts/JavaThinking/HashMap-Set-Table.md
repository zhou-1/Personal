# Hash Map    
Not ensure thread safe. Can use null as key. Initial volume is 16.       
Array + Linked list      
<b>HashMap.containsKey() method </b> is used for checking whether specified key map to HashMap, it uses key element as parameter, if element can map in map, it will return true.       


# Hash Table    
Use synchronized to ensure thread safe. Cannot use null as key. Initial volume is 11.     
Array + Linked list   

# Hash Set   
Not the construction of key-value, only store the elements not same, we can say HashSet as basic HashMap only keeps the key.
