----------------------------------

## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Remove all elements from a linked list of integers that have value val.      

Example:     
Input:  1->2->6->3->4->5->6, val = 6    
Output: 1->2->3->4->5     


----------------------------------

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

//Using dummy head: dummy "curr" will point to the last node while "head" pointing the first one.       

I. Iterative solution    
First, we shift a head of a list while its' value equals to val. Then, we iterate through the nodes of the list checking if the next node's value equals to val and removing it if needed.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
Iterative solution     

    public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {
        //First, we shift a head of a list while its' value equals to val.
        while(head != null && head.val == val){
            head = head.next;
        }
        
        ListNode curr = head;
        
        //Then, we iterate through the nodes of the list checking 
        //if the next node's value equals to val and removing it if needed.
        while(curr != null && curr.next != null){
            if(curr.next.val == val){
                curr.next = curr.next.next;
            }
            else{
                curr = curr.next;
            }
        }
        
        return head;
        
    }
