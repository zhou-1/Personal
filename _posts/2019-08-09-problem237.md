## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.       
Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:      
![Example Image1](img/img237.png )    

Example 1:     
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5   
Output: [4,1,9]     
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.     

Example 2:     
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1    
Output: [4,5,9]     
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.     

Note:   
The linked list will have at least two elements.    
All of the nodes' values will be unique.    
The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.    
Do not return anything from your function.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

Approach: Swap with Next Node [Accepted]    
The usual way of deleting a node node from a linked list is to modify the next pointer of the node before it, to point to the node after it.       
Since we do not have access to the node before the one we want to delete, we cannot modify the next pointer of that node in any way. Instead, we have to replace the value of the node we want to delete with the value in the node after it, and then delete the node after it.     
Because we know that the node we want to delete is not the tail of the list, we can guarantee that this approach is possible.      

Since we only have node, do not have head, we only can change the value of 

Why not good question?      
Because this question encourages us to use awkward method or dummy "skills" to solve it, which deviates the general principles for linked list manipulations. When we are asked to solve questions related to linked list, it is widely accepted to just use just node operations and it is not allowed to change node's value. If the values of nodes are allowed to be changed, will it make sense to call this problem related to linked list? If values are allowed to be changed, why don't we solve it in the form of arrays?

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
Swap with Next Node     

    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) { //node is the one we need to delete
    //actually here we change the value   
       node.val = node.next.val;
       node.next = node.next.next;
    }


### Code in Python.   
Same idea   

    def deleteNode(self, node):
       node.val = node.next.val
       node.next = node.next.next
