## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.     
For example, the following two linked lists:     
![Example Image1](img/img160-0.png )  
begin to intersect at node c1.     

Example 1:     
![Example Image1](img/img160-1.png )     
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3    
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8     
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.      

Example 2:     
![Example Image1](img/img160-2.png )        
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1     
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2    
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.      

Example 3:     
![Example Image1](img/img160-3.png )        
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2    
Output: null     
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.     
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.      

Notes:      
If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.     
The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.    
You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.    
Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

I. HashSet    
Traverse list A and store the address / reference to each node in a hash set. Then check every node bi in list B: if bi appears in the hash set, then bi is the intersection node.      
Complexity Analysis     
Time complexity : O(m+n).    
Space complexity : O(m) or O(n).        

II. Two Pointers    
Maintain two pointers pA and pB initialized at the head of A and B, respectively. Then let them both traverse through the lists, one node at a time.    
When pA reaches the end of a list, then redirect it to the head of B (yes, B, that's right.); similarly when pB reaches the end of a list, redirect it the head of A.    
If at any point pA meets pB, then pA/pB is the intersection node.    
To see why the above trick would work, consider the following two lists: A = {1,3,5,7,9,11} and B = {2,4,9,11}, which are intersected at node '9'. Since B.length (=4) < A.length (=6), pBpB would reach the end of the merged list first, because pBpB traverses exactly 2 nodes less than pApA does. By redirecting pBpB to head A, and pApA to head B, we now ask pBpB to travel exactly 2 more nodes than pApA would. So in the second iteration, they are guaranteed to reach the intersection node at the same time.    
If two lists have intersection, then their last nodes must be the same one. So when pApA/pBpB reaches the end of a list, record the last element of A/B respectively. If the two last elements are not the same one, then the two lists have no intersections.      
Complexity Analysis     
Time complexity : O(m+n)O(m+n).    
Space complexity : O(1)O(1).

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
HashSet     

    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        Set<ListNode> set = new HashSet<> ();
        
        while(headA != null){
            set.add(headA);
            headA = headA.next;
        }
        
        while(headB != null){
            if(set.contains(headB)){
                return headB;
            }
            else{
                headB = headB.next;
            }
        }
        
        return null;
    }

Two Pointers    

    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        //check extreme condition
        if(headA == null || headB == null){
            return null;
        }
        
        ListNode a = headA;
        ListNode b = headB;
        
        //if a & b have different len, then we will stop the loop after second iteration
        while( a != b){
    	    //for the end of first iteration, we just reset the pointer to the head of another linkedlist
            a = (a == null) ? headB : a.next;
            b = (b == null) ? headA : b.next;    
        }
    
        return a;
        
    }


### Code in Python.   
Two pointers    

    class Solution:
    # @param two ListNodes
    # @return the intersected ListNode
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        if headA is None or headB is None:
            return None

        pa = headA # 2 pointers
        pb = headB

        while pa is not pb:
            # if either pointer hits the end, switch head and continue the second traversal, 
            # if not hit the end, just move on to next
            pa = headB if pa is None else pa.next
            pb = headA if pb is None else pb.next

        return pa # only 2 ways to get out of the loop, they meet or the both hit the end=None

       # the idea is if you switch head, the possible difference between length would be countered. 
       # On the second traversal, they either hit or miss. 
       # if they meet, pa or pb would be the node we are looking for, 
       # if they didn't meet, they will hit the end at the same iteration, pa == pb == None, return either one of them is the same,None
