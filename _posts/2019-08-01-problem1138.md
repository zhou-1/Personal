## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

On an alphabet board, we start at position (0, 0), corresponding to character board[0][0].     
Here, board = ["abcde", "fghij", "klmno", "pqrst", "uvwxy", "z"], as shown in the diagram below.     
![Explain Image1](img/img1138.png ) 

We may make the following moves:     
'U' moves our position up one row, if the position exists on the board;   
'D' moves our position down one row, if the position exists on the board;   
'L' moves our position left one column, if the position exists on the board;   
'R' moves our position right one column, if the position exists on the board;   
'!' adds the character board[r][c] at our current position (r, c) to the answer.   
(Here, the only positions that exist on the board are positions with letters on them.)    

Return a sequence of moves that makes our answer equal to target in the minimum number of moves.  You may return any path that does so.    

Example 1:     
Input: target = "leet"    
Output: "DDR!UURRR!!DDD!"      

Example 2:     
Input: target = "code"   
Output: "RR!DDRR!UUL!R!"    

Constraints:    
1 <= target.length <= 100    
target consists only of English lowercase letters.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

Understanding this question is hard: [My post about understanding on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/alphabet-board-path/discuss/351596/Understanding-this-question-costs-me-around-2hrs!!)           

(i, j), (row, col) are current and next coordinates of the letters, respectively.     
Map [a-z] to [0-25], and use pos to denote the positon of a letter, then compute the letter's coordinates: row = pos / 5, col = pos % 5.    
If current letter is z, we must move upward before moving right; if next letter is z, must move left before moving downward.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
Indices manipulation     

    public String alphabetBoardPath(String target) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        
        for (int n = 0, i = 0, j = 0; n < target.length(); ++n) {
            int pos = target.charAt(n) - 'a, row = pos / 5, col = pos % 5;
            while (j > col) { // while loop of left (L) move before that of downward (D) move.
                sb.append('L');
                --j;
            }
            while (i > row) { // while loop of upward (U) move before that of right (R) move.
                sb.append('U');
                --i;
            }
            while (i < row) { // while loop of downward (D) move.
                sb.append('D');
                ++i;
            }
            while (j < col) { // while loop of right (R) move.
                sb.append('R');
                ++j;
            }
            sb.append('!');   
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
