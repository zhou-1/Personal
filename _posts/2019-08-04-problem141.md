## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.      
To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.     

Example 1:     
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1    
Output: true    
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
