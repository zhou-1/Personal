## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    

There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.      

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:     
If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.    
Otherwise, it becomes vacant.     

(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)     
We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: cells[i] == 1 if the i-th cell is occupied, else cells[i] == 0.     
Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after N days (and N such changes described above.)      

Example 1:     
Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7    
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]   
Explanation:     
The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:   
Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]    
Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]   
Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]   
Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]   
Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]   
Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]    
Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]    
Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]    

Example 2:    
cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], N = 1000000000    
Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]      

Note:     
cells.length == 8    
cells[i] is in {0, 1}    
1 <= N <= 10^9

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        

I. Simulation, state for representing state of prison, HashMap<>
We simulate each day of the prison. Because there are at most 256 possible states for the prison, eventually the states repeat into a cycle rather quickly. We can keep track of when the states repeat to find the period t of this cycle, and skip days in multiples of t.   
Let's do a naive simulation, iterating one day at a time. For each day, we will decrement N, the number of days remaining, and transform the state of the prison forward (state -> nextDay(state)). If we reach a state we have seen before, we know how many days ago it occurred, say t. Then, because of this cycle, we can do N %= t. This ensures that our algorithm only needs O(2âˆ— cells.length) steps.            

II. Intuition. Easy to just compare cells[i -1] wuth cells[i+1] for all N > 0. But it will get TLE when N is big.     

III. Record all seen states. we need transform array to string as the key, otherwise it use the reference.     
Since you only have 6 bits that are changing (first and last bit changes to 0 and stays 0). Total max possible distinct states are 2 ^ 6 = 64.      
Let's take an example. Assume you are asked the state after 10 ^ 9 days.     
You store the state in the map the first time you see a new state. Then when you see the same state again, you know that you have passed (lastSeen - currVal) state in between. So now you know your states repeat every (lastSeen - currVal) times. So finally you can mod the current N with that value to not repeat the same steps. Below is an example for 10^9 days.      

IV. Find the pattern of the loop. 
So once we enter the loop, every 14 steps must be the same state. The length of cells is even, so for any state, we can find a previous state. So all states are in a loop. It means that, after a single step from the initial state, we enter the loop.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.        
Intuition    

    public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int N) {
        while (N > 0) {
            N--;
            int[] cells2 = new int[8];
            for (int i = 1; i < 7; ++i)
                cells2[i] = (cells[i - 1] == cells[i + 1]) ? 1 : 0;
            cells = cells2;
        }
        return cells;
    }



Simulation     

    class Solution {
      public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int N) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap();

        // state  = integer representing state of prison
        int state = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
            if (cells[i] > 0)
                state ^= 1 << i;
        }

        // While days remaining, simulate a day
        while (N > 0) {
            // If this is a cycle, fast forward by
            // seen.get(state) - N, the period of the cycle.
            if (seen.containsKey(state)) {
                N %= seen.get(state) - N;
            }
            seen.put(state, N);

            if (N >= 1) {
                N--;
                state = nextDay(state);
            }
        }

        // Convert the state back to the required answer.
        int[] ans = new int[8];
        for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
            if (((state >> i) & 1) > 0) {
                ans[i] = 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
      }

      public int nextDay(int state) {
        int ans = 0;

        // We only loop from 1 to 6 because 0 and 7 are impossible,
        // as those cells only have one neighbor.
        for (int i = 1; i <= 6; ++i) {
            if (((state >> (i-1)) & 1) == ((state >> (i+1)) & 1)) {
                ans ^= 1 << i;
            }
        }

        return ans;
      }
    }



Record all seen states       

    public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int N) {
        
        Map<String, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
        
        while (N > 0) {
            int[] cells2 = new int[8];
            seen.put(Arrays.toString(cells), N--);
            
            for (int i = 1; i < 7; ++i)
                cells2[i] = cells[i - 1] == cells[i + 1] ? 1 : 0;
            
            cells = cells2;
            
            if (seen.containsKey(Arrays.toString(cells))) {
                N %= (seen.get(Arrays.toString(cells)) - N);  //(lastSeen - currVal) 
            }
        }
        
        return cells;
    }


Find the pattern of the loop.        

    public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int N) {
        for (N = (N - 1) % 14 + 1; N > 0; --N) {
            int[] cells2 = new int[8];
            for (int i = 1; i < 7; ++i)
                cells2[i] = cells[i - 1] == cells[i + 1] ? 1 : 0;
            cells = cells2;
        }
        return cells;
    }



### Code in Python.   
Record all seen states       

    def prisonAfterNDays(self, cells, N):
        seen = {str(cells): N}
        while N:
            seen.setdefault(str(cells), N)
            N -= 1
            cells = [0] + [cells[i - 1] ^ cells[i + 1] ^ 1 for i in range(1, 7)] + [0]
            if str(cells) in seen:
                N %= seen[str(cells)] - N
        return cells

Find the pattern of the loop.     

    def prisonAfterNDays(self, cells, N):
        N -= max(N - 1, 0) / 14 * 14
        for i in xrange(N):
            cells = [0] + [cells[i - 1] ^ cells[i + 1] ^ 1 for i in range(1, 7)] + [0]
        return cells
