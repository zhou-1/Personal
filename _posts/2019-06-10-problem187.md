## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.      
Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.     

Example:     
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"    
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
1. Creating two HashSet, one for storing all ten substrings in string, another one will store one substring if we cannot add one substring in set1 since set will not allow duplicates inside.      
2.

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
Two HashSet   

    class Solution {
     public List<String> findRepeatedDnaSequences(String s) {
        //prepare for result
        List<String> result = new ArrayList();
        
        //check for extreme condition
        if(s.length() < 10 || s == null){
            return result;
        }
        
        //Two HashSet
        HashSet set1 = new HashSet();
        HashSet set2 = new HashSet();
        
        for(int i = 0; i + 9 < s.length(); i++){
            String str = s.substring(i, i+10); //it includes the start, not the end; so it includes i to i+9
            if(!set1.add(str)){
                set2.add(str);
            }
        }
        
        result = new ArrayList<>(set2);
        return result;
        
     }
    }
