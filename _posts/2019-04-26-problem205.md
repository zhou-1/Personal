## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic. [同构]     
Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.    
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.    
Example 1:    
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"     
Output: true (abb)      
Example 2:   
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"    
Output: false (abb, abc)      
Example 3:   
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"   
Output: true (abacd)      
Note:   
You may assume both s and t have the same length.
