## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
In a array A of size 2N, there are N+1 unique elements, and exactly one of these elements is repeated N times.    
Return the element repeated N times.     

Example 1:    
Input: [1,2,3,3]   
Output: 3   
Example 2:    
Input: [2,1,2,5,3,2]   
Output: 2   
Example 3:   
Input: [5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4]   
Output: 5    

Note:    
4 <= A.length <= 10000   
0 <= A[i] < 10000   
A.length is even   


----------------------------------

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
My initial idea is using HashSet to record every element, and check with .contains(); if it is duplicate/contains already before, it is the result we need.    
My second idea is using HashMap<Integer, Integer> to record each element and its frequence. But no need for this.   
In solution, people are using compare with two for loops, it is not good.   
Or we can use array or set and return seen number at once.    
Or in python, we can use set to remove duplicates.    

----------------------------------

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
HashSet   

    class Solution {
     public int repeatedNTimes(int[] A) {
        //prepare an int for result
        int result = -1;
        
        //check for extreme condition
        //no need to worry here
        
        //create a hashset
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<> ();
        for(int a : A){
            if(set.contains(a)){
                return a;
            }
            set.add(a);
        }
        
        return result;
     }
    }

Array or set and return seen number at once.   

    public int repeatedNTimes(int[] A) {
        int[] count = new int[10000];
        for (int a : A)
            if (count[a]++ == 1)
                return a;
        return -1;
    }

Or   

    //it beats 100%   
    public int repeatedNTimes(int[] A) {
        int[] count = new int[10000];
        for (int a : A){
            count[a]++;
            if(count[a] == 2){
                return a;
            }
        }
            return -1;
    }


### Code in Python.   
Get the number of duplicate elements which are 2N - (N + 1） = N -1. Get the sum of duplicate elements and divide by number pf duplicate elements.     

    def repeatedNTimes(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        return int((sum(A)-sum(set(A))) // (len(A)//2-1))  # //:取整数
