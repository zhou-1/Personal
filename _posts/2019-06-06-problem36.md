## Question Description
Clear language for describing question.    
Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:     
Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.   
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.   
Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.     

![Explain Image1](img/img36.png )   
A partially filled sudoku which is valid.       

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.

Example 1:       
Input:     
[    
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],   
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],   
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],   
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],   
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],   
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],   
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],   
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],    
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]   
]   
Output: true   
Example 2:   
Input:  
[    
  ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],  
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],   
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],   
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],   
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],  
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],   
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],   
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],   
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]   
]    
Output: false    
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.     

Note:     
A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.    
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.   
The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.    
The given board size is always 9x9.

## My Thoughts
My thoughts for solving question after thinking and checking others' solving methods.        
My initial thought is creating three HashSet for row, column and 3* 3 sub-box. In every grid, if in the same row/column/sub=box, there is no duplicates, it is true, otherwise, return false.    
After check the discuss, I found that we can only use one HashSet for row/column/sub-box.    
*Note, for hashSet, we do not have to mention type of data then we can use mixed types.     


----------------------------------

## Code Exhibition
Talk is cheap, show me the code.    
### Code in Java.     
3 HashSets for row/column/sub-boxes.   

    class Solution {
     public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        //create three HashSets
        HashSet set1 = new HashSet (); //no need to mention type of data
        HashSet set2 = new HashSet ();
        HashSet set3 = new HashSet ();
        
        //check for very line, row , and 3*3 sub-boxes
        for(int i = 0; i < 9; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < 9; j++){
                if(board[i][j] != '.'){
                    if(!set1.add(board[i][j] + "in row" + i)){
                        return false;
                    }
                    else if(!set2.add(board[i][j] + "in column" + j)){
                        return false;
                    }
                    else if(!set3.add(board[i][j] + "in block" + i/3 + "-" + j/3)){
                        return false;
                    }
                    
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
        
     }
    }

One HashSet for three requirements.    

    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
     Set seen = new HashSet();
     for (int i=0; i<9; ++i) {
        for (int j=0; j<9; ++j) {
            char number = board[i][j];
            if (number != '.')
                if (!seen.add(number + " in row " + i) ||
                    !seen.add(number + " in column " + j) ||
                    !seen.add(number + " in block " + i/3 + "-" + j/3))
                    return false;
        }
     }
     return true;
    }


### Code in Python.

    def isValidSudoku(self, board):

      return True
    
    def is_square_valid(self, board):

        for j in (0, 3, 6):
            square = [board[x][y] for x in range(i, i + 3) for y in range(j, j + 3)]
            if not self.is_unit_valid(square):
                return False
       return True
    
    def is_unit_valid(self, unit):
      unit = [i for i in unit if i != '.']
      return len(set(unit)) == len(unit) //check if there is duplicate
